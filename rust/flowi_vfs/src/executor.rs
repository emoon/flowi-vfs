//! A single-threaded, frame-ticked local executor for cooperative multi-step
//! chains - the async-fn complement to the handle/poll
//! [`Handle<T>`](crate::Handle) surface the rest of the crate uses.
//!
//! [`LocalExecutor::tick`] is folded into the main-loop `*_update()` sweep, so
//! tasks resume on the thread that owns the UI context. The executor and its
//! tasks hold [`Rc`](std::rc::Rc) and are !Send + !Sync.
//!
//! [`spawn`](LocalExecutor::spawn) takes F: Future + 'static: a root task owns its
//! captures and returns its result. It must keep any state that survives an await
//! in those owned captures - never in a &frame_arena borrow held across one, since
//! the arena rewinds every frame.
//!
//! Dropping the [`Task`] handle cancels: it drops the in-flight future now, which
//! drops its captured leaf [`Handle`](crate::Handle)s and closes their C tickets
//! without blocking. There is no join-spin.
